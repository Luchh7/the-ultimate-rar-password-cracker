# the-ultimate-rar-password-cracker
This tool can crack the passwords of a RAR archive (I will update the tool to include ZIP archives in the future) using a dictionary attack.

HOW TO USE THE TOOL:

1. YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD 2 TOOLS TO MAKE THE SCRIPT WORKING:

Install John The Ripper from this website (make sure to download the version that matches your OS) : https://www.openwall.com/john/ 

Install hashcat from this website (download hashcat binaries) : https://hashcat.net/hashcat/

PS. i reccomend you to download this wordlist (rockyou.txt): https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt

Create a folder called 'zipcracker'on the Desktop and place all the files you downloaded from GitHub inside it. Create a folder named 'repositories' in the zipcracker folder and place John The Ripper and hashcat folders inside it after extracting them. Rename the hashcat folder to 'hashcat-6.2.6' and the John The Ripper folder to 'JohnTheRipper'.


Once you've completed all these steps, you can run the 'start.bat' file and follow the instructions provided in the file.

Here is where you can find the cracked password:

Obviusly everything is open-source, so you can check for viruses and modify the tool 


IF I'M NOT TOO LAZY AND HAVE TIME, I WILL IMPLEMENT BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS AND THE POSSIBILITY TO CRACK ZIP ARCHIVES IN ADDITION TO RAR ARCHIVES.
